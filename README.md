# Goals of the website Design 
  1. Have a header to jump to different sections
  2. Have multiple content sections that describe, market, and contact the company
  3. Have a footer with social media, etc

## Header
  1. Have company logo on it
  2. Have the content sections to jump to those

## Content Sections
  1. Section 1: Video/Gif. This section works pretty well to 'pop' out to the viewer.
  2. Section 2: Description Section. Describe company, values, maybe a list of events we've done recently?
  3. Section 3: Marketing, 'The Bramson Experience'. Mission statements, "quotes" from clients/attendees (will most likely have to keep this anonymous), locations we've been, etc.
  4. Section 4: Awards/News. Not sure if we have any awards or news lol, but a slow rotating carousel..
  5. Section 5: Contact section. Form fill out with first name, last name, email, message, reason for contact(?), captcha 

## Footer Section
  1. Company logo 
  2. Social media icons and links

### Ideas
  1. Have a list of employees w/ their faces? "Meet the Team" or something
  2. Maybe work with some people for marketing jargon for sections 2, 3, 4
  3. Work with Graphic Designers for cool images/gifs
